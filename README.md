# gamboge-nnet
C++/C# artificial neural network using R nnet derived parameters

C++ and C# code to predict values using an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN in this case operates the same as
the R statistical computing nnet library function nnet.predict. R can be used to train the neural network topology. The
resulting weights and topology parameters can then be used in a C++ or C# based application for prediction.
