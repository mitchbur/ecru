# gamboge-nnet
C++/C# artificial neural network using R nnet parameters

Small-scale C++ and C# library code to predict values using an artificial neural network (ANN).
The ANN in this case operates the same as the R statistical computing nnet library function nnet.predict.
R can be used to train the neural network topology. The resulting weights and topology parameters can 
then be used in a C++ or C# based application for prediction.
